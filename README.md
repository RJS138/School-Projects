## School-Projects
The projects within this directory are from my time at Penn State University. If a class code (ex. IST 100) exists then the assignemtns are for that class. I have some projects, mainly my python projects, that where created during a school year but not for specific assignments. 

The most polished and fully-featured projects are my python game projects as these are creations for major assignments for a couple classes.
